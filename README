      This repository serves as a Proof of Concept (PoC) of establishing a      
         hardware root of trust on the original IBM PC. Bootloaders are         
   cryptographically verified and matched against stored signatures in FLASH    
                memory. Yhi does not aim to be perfectly secure.
