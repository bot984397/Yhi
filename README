              --- Yhi - A secure IBM 5150 BIOS implementation ---               
                                                                                
      This repository serves as a Proof of Concept (PoC) of establishing a      
         hardware root of trust on the original IBM PC. Bootloaders are         
   cryptographically verified and matched against stored signatures in FLASH    
        memory. Yhi uses CRC32 for boot sector validation, and therefore        
          does not provide any real security factor. This project only          
                     serves as a theoretical demonstration.
