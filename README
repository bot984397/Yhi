              --- Yhi - A secure IBM 5150 BIOS implementation ---               
                                                                                
   This repository serves as a Proof of Concept (PoC) of porting several
   modern protocols / concepts to the original IBM PC.

   Currently implemented:        
      SecureBoot                                   
      PXE Boot                                    
                                                                                
                                 SecureBoot:                                   
   Yhi's SecureBoot implementation attempts to create a hardware root of      
   trust, used for boot sector validation and (optionally) encryption.       
   Boot sectors are cryptographically verified and matched against         
   enrolled hashes in FLASH memory.                        
   Yhi currently uses MD4 to compute said hashes.                 
                                                                                
                                   PXE Boot:                                    
   Yhi's PXE Boot implementation allows users to boot over ethernet, using     
   a NIC compatible with the IBM 5150's 8-bit ISA bus.               
   The network boot component is implemented as an optional expansion ROM,     
   which is scanned for and initialized during POST (NETBOOT.asm).         
   The boot server is implemented as a standalone Ada application.
